1435,https://www.mass.gov/directive/directive-93-7-exempt-sales-of-copying-machines-and-related-items,Not Criminal Justice Related,200,Directive 93-7: Exempt Sales of Copying Machines and Related Items | Mass.gov,"Sales and Use Tax ISSUE: When are retail sales of copying machines, related supplies, photocopies and service contracts exempt from sales tax? DIRECTIVE: Copying Machines. Retail sales of copying machines are subject to sales tax unless the copier is used directly and exclusively in an industrial plant in the actual manufacture of tangible personal property to be sold. See G.L. c. 64H, § 6(s). Supplies. The retail sale of copying machine supplies such as paper, toner and ink are exempt if the photocopies produced from these ingredient or component materials will be sold. See G.L. c. 64H, § 6(r). Retail sales of supplies that do not become an ingredient or component part of tangible personal property to be sold are exempt only if they are consumed and used directly and exclusively in an industrial plant in the actual manufacture of tangible personal property to be sold. See G.L. c. 64H, § 6(s). Photocopies. Retail sales of photocopies are subject to sales tax. Service Contracts. Generally, when the sales price of a service contract is separately stated from the sales price of the equipment and the purchase of the contract is optional, the purchase of the service contract is not subject to sales tax. The cost of a mandatory service contract which the buyer must purchase as part of the sale of the copying machine is included in the taxable sale price of the machine. See 830 CMR 64H.1.1(5)(g), for information regarding taxation of service contracts and replacement parts. Sales to Exempt Purchasers. Retail sales of tangible personal property, including copying machines, supplies and photocopies to government agencies or under certain circumstances to tax exempt organizations qualified under § 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, are exempt from tax under G.L. c. 64H, § 6(d) and § 6(e) respectively. DISCUSSION OF LAW: General Laws Chapter 64H, § 2, imposes a tax upon retail sales in the commonwealth by any vendor of tangible personal property or telecommunications services unless specifically exempt. The definition of ""sales"" includes leases and rentals. G.L. c. 64H, § 1. However, the sale of any item of tangible personal property may be exempt if it is sold for an exempt use or if it is sold to an exempt purchaser. 1. Exempt Use a. Copying Machines General Laws Chapter 64H, § 6(s), exempts from taxation sales of machinery, and its replacement parts, used directly and exclusively in an industrial plant in the actual manufacture of tangible personal property to be sold. Machinery is ""used directly and exclusively"" in the manufacture of tangible personal property to be sold only where it is used solely during a manufacturing operation to cause a direct and immediate physical change upon such property. Id. An industrial plant is a factory at a fixed location primarily engaged in the manufacture, conversion or processing of tangible personal property to be sold in the regular course of business. b. Supplies General Laws Chapter 64H, § 6(r), exempts from taxation sales of materials, tools and fuel, or their substitutes, which become an ingredient or component part of tangible personal property to be sold. Materials, tools and fuel which do not become an ingredient or component part of tangible personal property to be sold may be exempt if they are consumed and used directly and exclusively in an industrial plant in the actual manufacture of tangible personal property to be sold. Id. A material, tool or fuel is ""consumed and used directly and exclusively in an industrial plant in the actual manufacture of tangible personal property to be sold"" only if its normal useful life is less than one year, or if its cost is allowable as an ordinary and necessary business expense for federal income tax purposes. Id. 2. Exempt Purchaser General Laws Chapter 64H, § 6(d), exempts from sales tax sales to the United States, the commonwealth, or their respective agencies. Sales to organizations exempt from taxation pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (""tax exempt""), are exempt from sales tax provided that the tangible personal property sold is used in the conduct of the organization's exempt enterprise, and the organization obtains a certificate from the Commissioner of Revenue stating it is entitled to the exemption, and the vendor keeps a proper record of the sale. See G.L. c. 64H, § 6(e). EXAMPLES: 1. A company operating a photoprocessing business at a fixed location purchases a copying machine. The company's primary activity is the manufacturing of photographic images to be sold in the regular course of the company's business. The copying machine is used solely to cause a direct and immediate physical change upon the property to be sold during photoprocessing operations. The company also purchases supplies for the copying machine. The company's premises qualifies as a ""factory"" since the primary activity there consists of using mechanical power in photoprocessing manufacturing operations. See Letter Rulings 85-40 and 89-7, and Directive 88-9. The company's premises qualifies as an ""industrial plant"" because it consists of a factory at a fixed location used primarily for the manufacture of tangible personal property to be sold in the regular course of the company's business. The sale of the copying machine is exempt from tax since the machine is used directly and exclusively in an industrial plant in the actual manufacture of tangible personal property to be sold. The sales of supplies used in this machine are exempt if the supplies become an ingredient or component part of tangible personal property to be sold. Supplies that do not become an ingredient or component part of the tangible personal property sold are exempt only if they are consumed and used directly and exclusively in the industrial plant in the actual manufacture of tangible personal property to be sold. Sales of the photocopies are generally taxable. 2. Copying machines are leased for use by various ""tax exempt"" organizations that qualify for exemption under G.L. c. 64H, § 6(e) as discussed above and government entities, such as public universities and public libraries. These organizations and entities also purchase supplies for the copying machines, and make the copying machines availables to the general public. Leases of the copying machines and sales of supplies to qualified ""tax exempt"" organizations are exempt from taxation. Leases of the copying machines and sales of supplies to the federal government and its agencies, and to the commonwealth and its agencies, are exempt from taxation. Sales of tangible personal property by such ""tax exempt"" organizations and government agencies, however, are generally taxable. Thus, sales of photocopies by these institutions are generally subject to tax. See G.L. c. 64H, § 1, (definition of ""retailer""); see also DOR Directive 91-1 and Letter Ruling 92-3. CONCLUSION: Depending on the facts of each transaction, retail sales of copying machines, although generally taxable, may be exempt from taxation pursuant to G.L. c. 64H, § 6(d), § 6(e) or § 6(s). Sales of copying machine supplies, also generally taxable, may be exempt from taxation pursuant to G.L. c. 64H, § 6(d), § 6(e), § 6(r), or § 6(s). Generally, sales of photocopies are subject to tax. Exempt Usage. When claiming an exemption based on use pursuant to G.L. c. 64H, § 6(r) or § 6(s), a properly completed Form ST-12 certifying that the property is being purchased for an exempt use must be presented by the purchaser to the vendor. See 830 CMR 64H.8.1(5). Exempt Purchaser. When claiming an exemption as an exempt purchaser pursuant to G.L. c. 64H, § 6(d) or § 6(e), a properly completed Form ST-5 with an ST-2 copy (required for tax exempt organizations only) certifying that the purchaser is exempt must be presented by the purchaser to the vendor. See 830 CMR 64H.8.1(5). If a government entity claims the exemption but does not offer an Exempt Purchaser Certificate the vendor, to sell tax free, must obtain adequate documentation, generally, a copy of the government check, verifying that the purchaser is a government entity.   /s/Mitchell Adams Mitchell Adams Commissioner of Revenue   MA:HMP:kt   December 21, 1993   DOR-D 93-7","[""\nDirective\u00a0\n                Directive 93-7: Exempt Sales of Copying Machines and Related Items\n              ""]","[""Table of Contents"", ""Help Us Improve Mass.gov with your feedback""]",[],[],[],[]

Con el crecimiento de una ciudad próspera y la promesa de un mayor comercio en Detroit, surgen mayores preocupaciones de seguridad para las fuerzas del orden público, los dueños de negocios, los centros de culto y los ciudadanos por igual. Los sectores público y privado son más fuertes trabajando juntos que cada uno solo. Esta asociación es la piedra angular en la defensa de la Ciudad contra el terrorismo. DPD Shield es un destino central para obtener información crítica e involucrar a los recursos del departamento de policía. DPD Shield también busca información de nuestra comunidad y socios del sector privado para ayudar en nuestros esfuerzos para mantener la Ciudad Lo que pedimos El programa DPD SHIELD es una vía de comunicación de dos vías. La clave del éxito es que la información fluya en dos direcciones. Los socios de la comunidad sirven como los ojos y los oídos del DPD SHIELD y sirven para impactar directamente los esfuerzos para prevenir el crimen y los actos de terrorismo al informar sobre comportamientos sospechosos lo antes posible. Además, reconocemos que nuestros socios comunitarios están especialmente calificados para ayudar al personal del Departamento de Policía de Detroit durante un incidente.

The public and private sectors are stronger working together than either is alone. This partnership is the cornerstone in defending the City against terrorism. DPD Shield is a central destination to obtain critical information and engage police department resources. DPD Shield also seeks information from our community and private sector partners to assist in our efforts to keep the City   What We Ask The DPD SHIELD program is a communication two-way street. The key to success is information flowing in two directions. Community partners serve as the eyes and ears of the DPD SHIELD and serve to directly impact efforts to prevent crime and acts of terrorism by reporting suspicious behavior as soon as possible. In addition, we recognize that our community partners are uniquely qualified to assist the Detroit Police Department personnel during an incident. You know what belongs and what is out of place. Sharing your perspective and working together, we are better prepared to face the most difficult challenges.  ","[""\nCommunity Partner Resources\n""]","[""Top Links"", ""Site Menu"", ""\nDetroit Police Shield FAQs\n\n""]",[],"[""CONTACTS""]",[],[]

You inquire whether the ********** Center's purchase of the following equipment used in its printing operations is subject to the sales tax: (1) offset printing presses; (2) padding presses that bind cardboard or other backing to pads of paper; (3) folding machines; (4) machines used to staple booklets, brochures and the like; (5) collating machines; (6) paper-cutting machines; (7) paper drills; (8) joggers used to align sheets of paper into compact piles; (9) cameras used in plate-making; (10) light tables used for layout work and setting out printing jobs; and (11) typesetting machines. Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 64H, Section 6(r) exempts from sales taxation sales of materials, tools and fuel, or any substitute therefor, which are consumed and used directly and exclusively in an industrial plant in the actual manufacture of tangible personal property to be sold. Chapter 64H, Section 6(s) exempts from sales taxation sales of machinery or replacement parts thereof used directly and exclusively in an industrial plant in the actual manufacture, conversion or processing of tangible personal property to be sold. To be exempt, machinery must be (a) used solely during a manufacturing, conversion or processing operation 1. to effect a direct and immediate physical change upon tangible personal property to be sold; 2. to guide or measure a direct and immediate physical change upon such property where the guiding or measuring is an integral and essential part of tuning, verifying or aligning the parts of such property; or 3. to test or measure such property where the testing or measuring is an integral part of the production flow or function; or (b) used solely to 1. store; 2. transport or convey; or 3. handle such property during the operations listed in (a) above; or (c) used solely to place such property in the container, package or wrapping in which it is normally sold to the ultimate consumer. If machinery does not satisfy the above criteria, it is not exempt even if its operation, function or purpose is an integral or essential part of a continuous production flow or manufacturing process. Based on the foregoing, it is ruled that: (1) sales to the ********** Center of items (1) through (8) (the printing presses, padding presses, folding, stapling, collating and paper-cutting machines, paper drills and joggers) are exempt from tax; and (2) sales to the ********** Center of items (9) through (11) (the cameras used in platemaking, light tables and typesetting machines) are subject to tax.

DWSD tiene un programa de mantenimiento preventivo agresivo, un Programa de mejora de capital de cinco años para comenzar a abordar nuestra infraestructura obsoleta y cuenta con un equipo de servicios de campo capacitado que responde a las emergencias. Si necesita informar una emergencia de agua o alcantarillado, llame al 313-267-8000 y presione la opción 4, o use la aplicación móvil de Improve Detroit . SISTEMA DE AGUA: El sistema de agua en Detroit incluye las plantas de tratamiento de agua potable, bombas, líneas de transmisión, tuberías de distribución o cañerías de agua, válvulas, hidrantes y líneas de servicio de agua. Mira este video animado . ¿Tiene una rotura principal de agua? Los inviernos fríos de Detroit, los deshielos primaverales y el calor extremo del verano pueden provocar roturas en las tuberías que llevan el agua a nuestros clientes. Cada vez que el suelo cambia debido a cambios drásticos de temperatura, puede ejercer presión sobre las tuberías. El Departamento de Agua y Alcantarillado de Detroit (DWSD) tiene un programa agresivo de detección de fugas y un Programa de Mejora de Capital para actualizar el sistema. Tú también puedes ayudar. Se pueden perder millones de galones de valiosos recursos de agua potable en poco tiempo, por lo que la detección rápida de una ruptura de la tubería de agua es fundamental. Si sospecha que hay una fuga en su vecindario, llámenos al 313-267-8000 o use la aplicación móvil de Improve Detroit . Mire este video para aprender cómo DWSD responde a las roturas de tuberías principales. ¿Quién es responsable de las tuberías de agua? DWSD es responsable del mantenimiento del sistema de distribución de agua, incluidas las tuberías principales y de servicio de agua hasta el tope de la acera (válvula de encendido/apagado cerca o en la acera). El dueño de la propiedad es responsable de la línea de servicio de agua desde la acera hasta el interior de la casa o negocio y la plomería interna dentro de la casa/estructura. Si la parte privada de la línea de servicio de agua se agrieta o falla, es responsabilidad del dueño de la propiedad contratar a un plomero con licencia y obtener el permiso de la ciudad correspondiente para realizar la reparación. Ver imagen a continuación. DRENAJE: El sistema de recolección de alcantarillado en Detroit consta de líneas laterales de alcantarillado (privadas), tuberías de recolección de alcantarillado que utilizan principalmente la gravedad, tuberías de aguas pluviales, sumideros, infraestructura verde de aguas pluviales , bombas, instalaciones de desbordamiento de alcantarillado combinado y la planta de tratamiento de aguas residuales. ¿Está su calle inundada? DWSD lanzó un programa de inspección y limpieza de cuencas colectoras en 2017 para reducir las inundaciones en las calles de los vecindarios. Hasta noviembre de 2020, los equipos de DWSD han inspeccionado y limpiado 30 000 sumideros (drenajes pluviales). Hay aproximadamente 90,000 sumideros que DWSD es responsable de mantener. Esto no incluye las cuencas en autopistas, carreteras estatales o del condado, como M-10 Lodge Freeway y Woodward Avenue, que son responsabilidad del MDOT. Lea sobre el programa aquí . Si experimenta inundaciones en las calles, por su seguridad, no conduzca ni camine por un área inundada. Repórtelo llamando al 313-267-8000 y presione la opción 4, o use la aplicación móvil de Improve Detroit . Se alienta a los propietarios/inquilinos a que recojan los recortes de césped, las hojas, la basura y otros desechos frente a sus hogares y negocios y los eliminen adecuadamente, ya sea en el césped o en bolsas de basura. Los escombros que no se barren ni se quitan con una pala del frente de su propiedad pueden obstruir los sumideros y potencialmente inundar su calle. Mire este video para obtener más información . ¿Tiene un desbordamiento o una copia de seguridad de alcantarillado? Comuníquese con DWSD al 313-267-8000 y presione la opción 4 o use la aplicación móvil Improve Detroit al descubrir un desbordamiento o un desbordamiento de alcantarillado. Si tiene un desbordamiento o un desbordamiento de alcantarillado en su hogar o negocio, consulte la información de reclamo por daños de DWSD. La ley estatal requiere que presente un reclamo por escrito con su empresa local de servicios de agua, DWSD en este caso, dentro de los 45 días posteriores al descubrimiento del desbordamiento o el desbordamiento. ¿Quién es responsable de las tuberías de alcantarillado? DWSD es responsable del sistema de recolección de alcantarillado. Los propietarios son responsables de los drenajes dentro de la casa/estructura, en la propiedad privada y la línea de alcantarillado que viene desde la estructura hasta la conexión en la tubería de recolección de alcantarillado de la ciudad.

We as a police department have a responsibility to those communities, to address their concerns and take appropriate enforcement action in an effort to keep their neighborhoods safe.

Due to privacy considerations, exact CCNs and arrest numbers for these arrest datasets are not provided. In lieu, hash numbers are provided for CNN which allows individuals to determine whether there are multiple arrests associated with one event. Additionally, arrest numbers can be linked directly to an individual and therefore DC government does not provide this more generally, but again as hash numbers.",[],[],[],[],[],[]
